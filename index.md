# NimbleSim

**Nimble is currently in early-access.**

**NimbleSim** is a component-based behaviour orchestration framework for Unity that makes AI feel more like *storytelling* and less like plumbing.

It lets you define your game agents' behaviour using readable, declarative sequences built from atomic actions â€” just like building Legos. The result is expressive, modular, and infinitely composable behaviour code that stays easy to write, easy to understand, and easy to maintain.

<!-- <div className="flex">
  <h2>
      <a href="/home/what-it-solves.html">What is it trying to solve?</a>
  </h2>
</div> -->

[What is it trying to solve?](./home/what-it-solves.html){: .btn .btn-purple .mr-2 }
