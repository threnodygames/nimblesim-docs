# NimbleSim

**Nimble is currently in early-access.**

**NimbleSim** is a component-based behaviour orchestration framework for Unity that makes AI feel more like *storytelling* and less like plumbing.

It lets you define your game agents' behaviour using readable, declarative sequences built from atomic actions ‚Äî just like building Legos. The result is expressive, modular, and infinitely composable behaviour code that stays easy to write, easy to understand, and easy to maintain.

## üõ†Ô∏è Core Concepts

NimbleSim is built on two building blocks:

### ‚úÖ Actions

Actions are classes which represent some behaviour or intent. While it is valid to build sequences using lambdas, actions provide a significantly higher level of control.

For example, a Goto action may look like this:

```csharp
public class Goto : Action
{
  Vector3 destination;
  float speed = 6.0f;

  public Goto(Vector3 destination)
  {
    this.destination = destination;
  }

  public override void Update(GameObject actor)
  {
    actor.transform.position = Vector3.MoveTowards(
      actor.transform.position,
      destination,
      speed * Time.deltaTime
    );
  }

  protected override bool IsComplete(GameObject actor)
  {
    return Vector3.Distance(actor.transform.position, destination) < 0.5f;
  }

  public override Action Get()
  {
    return new Goto(destination);
  }
}
```

This action encapsulates its behaviour (move towards something) and its termination condition (within 0.5f units) into a contained block. And because actions don't need to know about the actor who will be executing it until after instantiation, it only needs to be written once and then can be passed to any sequence at all.

Actions can also implement methods which provide precise control over their execution. For example:

- IsComplete() - defines a clear termination condtion for the action
- OnStart() - executed when an action becomes active in a sequence, immediately before the first update call
- OnDone() - executed immediately after the action's final update call, right before it becomes inactive in a sequence

But these are optional.

### üß± Sequences

Sequences are a series of steps which are run in some order.

```csharp
Nimble.Sim()
    .First(GoToStore())
    .If(StoreHasMilk())
      .Then(BuyMilk())
      .Or(KnockOverTheShelf())
    .Done()
```

Sequences support composing:

- lambas
- actions
- other sequences

This enables you to create complex & recursive behaviours from small, dedidcated & reusable units.
