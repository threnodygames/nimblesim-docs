# NimbleSim

**Nimble is currently in early-access.**

**NimbleSim** is a component-based behaviour orchestration framework for Unity that makes AI feel more like *storytelling* and less like plumbing.

It lets you define your game agents' behaviour using readable, declarative sequences built from atomic actions â€” just like building Legos. The result is expressive, modular, and infinitely composable behaviour code that stays easy to write, easy to understand, and easy to maintain.
