# Village Simulation

## 🏡 What we'll build

A living, reactive village simulation where resources are gathered, systems strain, and life (or death) emerges from simple rules.

## 🛠️ How we'll do it

1. **Create villagers** with metabolic needs — hunger, thirst, sickness, and death
2. **Assign jobs** like farming, water gathering, and healing
3. **Place work zones** such as farms and lakes where villagers travel to gather resources
4. **Build a food hall** to store and distribute goods on a first-come, first-serve basis
5. **Add a day/night cycle**, prompting villagers to sleep at night
6. **Introduce chaos**: chance-based disease, laziness, or violence — straining the resource network and the healers
7. **Trigger disasters** like fires that must be handled fast or risk spiraling into shortages
8. **Add realtime stats** so we can monitor the state of the village
9. **Add player interactions** so we can help or hinder the village
